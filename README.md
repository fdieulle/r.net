# r.net
r.net is a r package that allows to use .Net assemblies from R environment.
The data conversion use mainly another github repository see: https://github.com/jmp75/rdotnet-onboarding
Thank you to creators and contributors of this repository.
This package is inspired from another r package named rclr implemented by jperraud see: https://rclr.codeplex.com/
I decide to fork it because i need many improvements in data conversion which are not easy to implements in the original rclr package.
